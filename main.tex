\section{Questions} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the six step troubleshooting process? 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Identify the problem
        \item Establish a theory of probable cause. (Question the obvious) 
        \item Test the theory to determine cause
        \item Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement a solution
        \item Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventative measures. 
        \item Document findings, actions, and outcomes 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To which type of technology would you install a x16 card?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) is the most common expansion slot for video cards (by sixteen) 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which process of the computer checks all your components dur‐
ing boot?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item POST (Power-On Self Test) is a process that is part of the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). It runs a self-check of the computer system during boot and stores many of the parameters of the components within the CMOS. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following could cause the POST to fail? (Select
the two best answers.) 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The CPU and Memory need to be installed properly for the POST to run (and to pass). 
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Which of the following might you find as part of a tablet com‐
puter? (Select the two best answers.)   
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A tablet computer will almost always  contain flash memory as main storage and multi-touch screen. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which kind of socket incorporates “lands” to ensure connectiv‐
ity to a CPU? 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item LGA (land grid array) is the type of socket that
uses “lands” to connect the socket to the CPU.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item How many pins are inside an SATA 3.0 data connector? 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The SATA version 3.0 data connector has seven pins. Note: SATA express uses a tiple connector with 18 pins ( 7 + 7 + 4) 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What is the minimum number of hard drives necessary to imple‐
ment RAID 5?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Because RAID 5 uses striping with parity, a third disk is needed. You can have more than three disks as well. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A user’s time and date keep resetting to January 1, 2012. Which
of the following is the most likely cause?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the time and date keep resetting - for example, to a date such as January 1,2012 - chances are that the lithium battery needs to be replaced. These are usually nickle-sized batteries; most PCs use a CR2032 lithium battery. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which type of adapter card is normally plugged into a PCIe x16
adapter card slot?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The PCI Express (PCIe) x16 expansion slot is used
primarily for video.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following CPU cooling methods is the most com‐
mon?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The most common CPU cooling method is the heat
sink and fan combination. The heat sink helps the heat to disperse
away from the CPU, whereas the fan blows the heat down and
through the fins; the power supply exhaust fan and possibly addi‐
tional case fans help the heat escape the case. Heat sink and fan
combinations are known as active cooling methods.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What type of power connector is used for a x16 video card?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item PCIe 6-pin
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What does the b in 1000 Mbps stand for?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The b in 1000 Mbps stands for bits: 1000 Mbps is
1000 megabits per second or 1 gigabit per second. Remember
that the lowercase b is used to indicate bits when measuring net‐
work data transfer rates, USB data transfer rates, and other simi‐
lar serial data transfers.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item When running cable through drop ceilings, which type of cable do
you need?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Plenum-rated cable needs to be installed wherever
a sprinkler system is not able to spray water. This includes ceil‐
ings, walls, and plenums (airways). Plenum-rated cable has a pro‐
tective covering that burns slower and gives off fewer toxic
fumes than regular PVC-based cable.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following is the default subnet mask for IP address
192.168.1.1?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 192.168.1.1, by default, has the subnet mask
255.255.255.0, which is the standard subnet mask for class C IP
addresses. However, remember that some networks are classless,
which means that a network can use a different subnet mask.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following is the minimum category cable needed for
a 1000BASE-T network?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The minimum cable needed for 1000BASE-T net‐
works is Category 5e. Of course, Cat 6 would also work, but it is
not the minimum of the listed answers. 1000BASE-T specifies
the speed of the network (1000 Mbps), the type (baseband, single
shared channel), and the cable to be used (T = twisted pair).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following IP addresses can be routed across the In‐
ternet?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The only listed answer that is a public address
(needed to get onto the Internet) is 129.52.50.13
        \item All the other answers are private IPs, meant
to be behind a firewall. 127.0.0.1 is the IPv4 local loopback IP
address. 192.168.1.1 is a common private IP address used by
SOHO networking devices. 10.52.50.13 is a private address.
Note that the 10 network is common in larger networks.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which port number is used by HTTPS by default?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
uses port 443 (by default).
        \item Port 21 is used by the File Transfer Protocol
(FTP). Port 25 is used by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP). Port 80 is used by regular HTTP, which is considered to
be insecure.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following cable types have a copper medium? (S‐
elect the three best answers.)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Twisted-pair, coaxial, and Category 7 cable are all
examples of network cables with a copper medium. They all send
electricity over copper wire. 
        \item ultimode is a type of fiber-optic cable; it
uses light to send data over a glass or plastic medium. Twisted
pair is the most common type of cabling used in today’s net‐
works.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which of the following cable types can protect from electromag‐
netic interference (EMI)? (Select the two best answers.)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Shielded twisted pair (STP) and fiber optic can
protect from EMI. 
        \item Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cannot pro‐
tect from EMI. Unless otherwise mentioned, Category 6 cable is
UTP. STP is shielded twisted pair. Unlike UTP (unshielded
twisted pair), STP provides an aluminum shield that protects
from EMI. UTP and coaxial have no such protection. Fiber optic
uses a different medium altogether, transmitting light rather than
electricity; therefore, EMI cannot affect fiber-optic cables.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item You are configuring Bob’s computer to access the Internet. Which
of the following are required? (Select all that apply.)
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To get on the Internet, the DNS server address is
required so that the computer can get the resolved IP addresses
from the domain names that are typed in. The gateway address is
necessary to get outside the network.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A customer wants to access the Internet from many different loca‐
tions in the United States. Which of the following is the best tech‐
nology to enable the customer to do so?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Cellular WAN uses a phone or other mobile device
to send data over standard cellular connections.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item You just configured the IP address 192.168.0.105 in Windows.
When you press the Tab key, Windows automatically configures
the default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Which of the following
IP addresses is a suitable gateway address?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 192.168.0.1 is the only suitable gateway address.
Remember that the gateway address must be on the same net‐
work as the computer. In this case, the network is 192.168.0, as
defined by the 255.255.255.0 subnet mask.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item You have been tasked with blocking remote logins to a server.
Which of the following ports should you block?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ort 23 should be blocked. It is associated with the
Telnet service, which is used to remotely log in to a server at the
command line. You can block this service at the company fire‐
wall and individually at the server and other hosts. It uses port 23
by default, but it can be used with other ports as well. Telnet is
considered to be insecure, so it should be blocked and disabled.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	connector	types	is	used	by	fiber-optic	ca‐
bling?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	LC	connector	is	used	by	fiber-optic	cabling.
Other	fiber	connectors	include	SC	and	ST.
        \item RJ45	is	the	connector	used	by	twisted-pair
networks.	RG-6	is	the	cable	used	by	cable	Internet	and	TV;	an	F-
connector	is	attached	to	the	ends	of	an	RG-6	cable.	RJ11	is	the
standard	phone	line	connector.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	protocol	uses	port	53?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	Domain	Name	System	(DNS)	protocol	uses
port	53	by	default. 
        \item TP	uses	port	21.	SMTP	uses	port	25	(or	587 or	465).	HTTP uses port	80.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	terms	best	describes	two	or	more	LANs
connected	over	a	large	geographic	distance?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A	wide-area	network	(WAN)	is	a	network	in	which
two	or	more	LANs	are	connected	over	a	large	geographic	dis‐
tance—for	example,	between	two	cities.	The	WAN	requires	con‐
nections	to	be	provided	by	a	telecommunications	or	data	commu‐
nications	company.
    \end{enumerate} 
        \item Which	device	connects	to	the	network	and	has	the	sole	purpose	of
providing	data	to	clients?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Network-attached	storage	(NAS)	devices	store	data
for	network	use.	They	connect	directly	to	the	network.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item You	are	making	your	own	networking	patch	cable.	You	need	to
attach	an	RJ45	plug	to	the	end	of	a	twisted-pair	cable.	Which	tool
should	you	use?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	Use	an	RJ45	crimper	tool	to	permanently	attach
RJ45	plugs	to	the	end	of	a	cable

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	port	is	used	by	RDP?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	Remote	Desktop	Protocol	(RDP)	uses	port
3389	by	default.	This	protocol	allows	one	computer	to	take control	of	another	remote	system.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	printer	failures	can	be	described	as	a	con‐
dition	in	which	the	internal	feed	mechanism	stopped	working
temporarily?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A	failure	that	occurs	due	to	the	internal	feed	mech‐
anism	stopping	is	known	as	a	paper	jam.	For	example,	an	HP
LaserJet	might	show	error	code	13.1	on	the	display,	which	means
a	paper	jam	at	the	paper	feed	area.	You	should	verify	that	the	pa‐
per	trays	are	loaded	and	adjusted	properly.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	type	of	printer	uses	a	toner	cartridge?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Laser	printers	use	toner	cartridges.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	should	not	be	connected	to	a	UPS?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Laser	printers	use	large	amounts	of	electricity,
which	in	turn	could	quickly	drain	the	battery	of	the	UPS.	They
should	be	plugged	in	to	their	own	individual	power	strips.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Special	paper	is	needed	to	print	on	which	type	of	printer?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	Regular	paper	can	be	used	on	all	the	listed	printers
except	for	thermal	printers,	which	use	specially	coated	paper	that
is	heated	to	create	the	image.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	channels	should	you	select	for	an	802.11
wireless	network?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Of	the	listed	answers,	use	channel	6	for	802.11
wireless	networks.	That	would	imply	a	2.4	GHz	connection	using
either	802.11n,	g,	or	b.	The	2.4	GHz	frequency	range	in	the
United	States	allows	for	channels	1	through	11.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	environmental	issue	affects	a	thermal	printer	the	most?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Which	type	of	printer	uses	impact	to	transfer	ink	from	a	ribbon	to
the	paper?

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	steps	enables	you	to	take	control	of	a	net‐
work	printer	from	a	remote	computer?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	After	you	install	the	driver	for	the	printer	locally,
you	can	then	take	control	of	it	by	going	to	the	properties	of	the
printer	and	accessing	the	Ports	tab.	Then	click	the	Add	Port	but‐
ton	and	select	the	Standard	TCP/IP	Port	option.	You	have	to
know	the	IP	address	of	the	printer	or	the	computer	that	the	printer
is	connected	to.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item 	A	color	laser	printer	produces	images	that	are	tinted	blue.	Which
of	the	following	steps	should	be	performed	to	address	this	prob‐
lem?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item After	you	install	a	printer,	it	is	important	to	cali‐
brate	it	for	color	and	orientation,	especially	if	you	are	installing	a
color	laser	printer	or	an	inkjet	printer.	These	calibration	tools	are
usually	built	in	to	the	printer’s	software	and	can	be	accessed	from
Windows,	or	you	can	access	them	from	the	printer’s	display.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item A	desktop	computer	does	not	have	a	lit	link	light	on	the	back	of
the	computer.	Which	of	the	following	is	the	most	likely	reason	for
this?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	most	likely	answer	in	this	scenario	is	that	the
network	cable	is	disconnected.	If	the	desktop	computer	is	using	a
wired	connection,	it	is	most	likely	a	twisted-pair	Ethernet	con‐
nection.	When	this	cable	is	connected	to	the	computer	on	one	end
and	to	a	switch	or	other	central	connecting	device	on	the	other
end,	it	initiates	a	network	connection	over	the	physical	link.	This
link	then	causes	the	network	adapter’s	link	light	to	light	up.	The
link	light	is	directly	next	to	the	RJ45	port	of	the	network	adapter.
The	corresponding	port	on	the	switch	(or	other	similar	device)	is
also	lit.	If	the	cable	is	disconnected,	the	link	light	becomes	unlit,
though	there	are	other	possibilities	for	this	link	light	to	be	dark—
for	example,	if	the	computer	is	off	or	if	the	switch	port	is	dis‐
abled.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	IP	addresses	would	a	technician	see	if	a
computer	running	Windows	is	connected	to	a	multifunction	net‐
work	device	and	is	attempting	to	obtain	an	IP	address	automati‐
cally	but	is	not	receiving	an	IP	address	from	the	DHCP	server?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If	the	computer	fails	to	obtain	an	IP	address	from	a
DHCP	server,	Windows	will	take	over	and	apply	an	Automatic
Private	IP	Address	(APIPA).	This	address	will	be	on	the
169.254.0.0	network.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item For	which	type	of	PC	component	are	80	mm	and	120	mm	com‐
mon	sizes?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Case	fans	are	measured	in	mm	(millimeters);	80
mm	and	especially	120	mm	are	very	common.	They	are	used	to
exhaust	heat	out	of	the	case.	These	fans	aid	in	keeping	the	CPU
and	other	devices	cool.	The	120	mm	is	quite	common	in	desktop
and	tower	PCs,	and	the	80	mm	is	more	common	in	smaller	sys‐
tems	and	1U	and	2U	rackmount	servers.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item An	exclamation	point	next	to	a	device	in	the	Device	Manager	in‐
dicates	which	of	the	following?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If	you	see	an	exclamation	point	in	the	Device	Man‐
ager,	this	indicates	that	the	device	does	not	have	a	proper	driver.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Beep	codes	are	generated	by	which	of	the	following?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item As	the	power-on	self-test	(POST)	checks	all	the
components	of	the	computer,	it	may	present	its	findings	on	the
screen	or	in	the	form	of	beep	codes.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	indicates	that	a	printer	is	network-ready?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	RJ45	jack	enables	a	connection	to	a	twisted-
pair	(most	likely	Ethernet)	network.	Printers	with	a	built-in	RJ45
connector	are	network-ready;	so	are	printers	that	are	Wi-Fi	en‐
abled.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item You	just	turned	off	a	printer	to	maintain	it.	Which	of	the	follow‐
ing	should	you	be	careful	of	when	removing	the	fuser?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	The	fuser	heats	paper	to	around	400°	Fahrenheit
(204°	Celsius).	That’s	like	an	oven.	If	you	need	to	replace	the
fuser,	let	the	printer	sit	for	10	or	15	minutes	after	shutting	it	down
and	before	maintenance.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	connectors	is	used	for	musical	equipment?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	Musical	Instrument	Digital	Interface	(MIDI)
connector	is	used	for	musical	equipment	such	as	keyboards,	syn‐
thesizers,	and	sequencers.	MIDI	is	used	to	create	a	clocking	sig‐
nal	that	all	devices	can	synchronize	to.
        
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	storage	technologies	is	used	by	hard
disk	drives?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Hard	disk	drives	(HDDs)	are	magnetic	disks.	Th‐
ese	are	the	type	with	moving	parts,	as	opposed	to	solid-state
drives	(SSDs)	that	have	no	moving	parts.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	protocol	uses	port	389?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item LDAP 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	wireless	networking	standards	operates
at	5	GHz	only?	(Select	the	two	best	answers.)

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item :	802.11a	operates	at	5	GHz	only;	so	does	802.11ac.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	types	of	RAM	has	a	peak	transfer	rate	of
21,333	MB/s?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item DDR4-2666	has	a	peak	transfer	rate	of	21,333
MB/s.	It	runs	at	an	I/O	bus	clock	speed	of	1333	MHz	and	can
send	2666	megatransfers	per	second	(MT/s).	It	is	also	known	as
PC4-21333.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	types	of	printers	uses	a	print	head,	ribbon,
and	tractor	feed?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The	impact	printer	uses	a	print	head,	ribbon,	and
tractor	feed.	An	example	of	an	impact	printer	is	the	dot	matrix.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	is	a	possible	symptom	of	a	failing	CPU?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If	the	CPU	is	running	beyond	the	recommended
voltage	range	for	extended	periods	of	time,	it	can	be	a	sign	of	a
failing	CPU.	The	problem	could	also	be	caused	by	overclocking.
Check	in	the	UEFI/BIOS	to	see	whether	or	not	the	CPU	is	over‐
clocked.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	cable	types	is	not	affected	by	EMI	but	re‐
quires	specialized	tools	to	install?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Fiber-optic	cable	is	the	only	answer	listed	that	is
not	affected	by	electromagnetic	interference	(EMI).	The	reason	is
that	it	does	not	use	copper	wire	or	electricity,	but	instead	uses
glass	or	plastic	fibers	and	light.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Setting	an	administrator	password	in	the	BIOS	accomplishes
which	of	the	following?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Changing boot order
    \end{enumerate}
    \item What	is	an	LCD	display’s	contrast	ratio	defined	as?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 	Contrast	ratio	is	the	brightness	of	the	brightest
color	(measured	as	white)	compared	to	the	darkest	color	(mea‐
sured	as	black).	Static	contrast	ratio	measurements	are	static;	they
are	performed	as	tests	using	a	checkerboard	pattern.	But	there	is
also	the	dynamic	contrast	ratio,	a	technology	in	LCD	displays
that	adjusts	dynamically	during	darker	scenes	in	an	attempt	to
give	better	black	levels.	It	usually	has	a	higher	ratio,	but	it	should
be	noted	that	there	is	no	real	uniform	standard	for	measuring	con‐
trast	ratio.

    \end{enumerate}
    \item Which	of	the	following	devices	limits	network	broadcasts,	seg‐
ments	IP	address	ranges,	and	interconnects	different	physical	me‐
dia?

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A	router	can	limit	network	broadcasts	through	seg‐
menting	and	programmed	routing	of	data.	This	is	part	of	a
router’s	job	when	connecting	two	or	more	networks.	It	is	also
used	with	different	media.	For	example,	you	might	have	a	LAN
